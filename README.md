ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @EasySouls

I am in my 11th year in middle school and learning programming by myself.
I am focusing on WebDev and currently starting to get into C++.
My first bigger project is meant to be a text-based rpg game, which currently runs on the console only, but I'll choose something nicer output option later once I finish the project :D
